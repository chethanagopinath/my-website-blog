I was Diversity Chair at PyCascades 2024. 

Let me start by saying I had never been to an in-person tech conference before.

I did help organize PyCascades in 2023 but I did not get my visa in time for me to get to Vancouver.

Coming back to PyCascades 2024, it was a perfect setting - April in Seattle, cherry blossom season and the conference happened at Kane Hall in University of Washington (UDub :)) 

The conference was from April 5, 2024 to April 8, 2024. 

Takeaways coming in soon!
