			<p>Hello, my name is Chethana 👋🏼 </p>
			<p>I'm a software engineer residing in sunny California ☀️ <br/> I enjoy learning, solving problems, and spending my free time experimenting with new cuisines and flavors in the kitchen and exploring beautiful scenic places. </p>
			<p>I have about 3 years of full-stack engineering in the US and 2 years of SDET experience in India. Additionally, I also have bachelors and masters degrees in Computer Science - so, overall, I have been in the tech space since 2012 💻 </p>
			<p>At my day job, I work with Python (Flask, FastAPI), Javascript, GraphQL, PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy) and AWS. I have familiarity with a few more technologies along the way with my years of experience in Computer Science. </p>
			<p>My biggest super power ✨ <br/>
				I can work without much direction, getting answers to the specific questions that I want (although knowing what to solve for is a hard problem sometimes) and execute with velocity and good quality code.
