			<p>Hello, my name is Chethana 👋🏼 </p>
			<p>I'm a software engineer residing in sunny California ☀️ <br/> I enjoy learning, solving problems, and spending my free time experimenting with new cuisines and flavors in the kitchen and exploring beautiful scenic places. </p>
			<h4>Experience and work</h4>
			<p>I have about 3 years of full-stack engineering in the US and 2 years of SDET experience in India. Additionally, I also have bachelors and masters degrees in Computer Science - so, overall, I have been in the tech space since 2012 💻 </p>
			<p>At my day job, I primarily work with Python (Flask, FastAPI), Javascript, GraphQL, PostgreSQL (SQLAlchemy) and AWS. On the side, I toy with a few more technologies like Astro, NextJS & Ruby on Rails.</p>
			<h4>Volunteering</h4>
			<p>I volunteered with Women Who Code Python putting out technical content, moderating and helping with events, see my playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMIayWmKaV57WlW_vIn6Is8H2r2J1hAYX" style="text-decoration:None">here</a>.</p>
			<p>Additionally, I have been helping to organize <a href="https://2024.pycascades.com/" style="text-decoration:None">PyCascades</a> for the past 2 years and am currently working as Accessibility Chair for PyCascades 2025.</p>
			<h4>My biggest super power ✨ </h4>
			<p>I can work without much direction, getting answers to the specific questions that I want (although knowing what to solve for is a hard problem sometimes) and execute with velocity and good quality code.</p>
